# Snoqualmie-Weather
One of my favorite hobbies during the winter is snowboarding. It all started 3 years ago and ever since, I have been obessed. Something about the quietness in snow, fluffy ground, and 
views from the top of the mountain brings me to peace in a way nothing else has. But, one thing I find my self spending a lot of time doing is checking the weather to see when it's
going to be the perfect time to go. So... I developed a reddit bot that makes post to a subreddit to let me and/or other users know in advance when it is going to snow in Snoqualmie,
WA. For this code I used a reddit api from reddit to create the bot, and a weather api from https://openweathermap.org/ to obtain weather information.
